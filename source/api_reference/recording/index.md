# Recording and playback

Genesis World records simulation data through a recorder framework: register a recorder with the scene, describe *what* to sample, then step the scene as usual. The recorder samples on its own schedule and either writes the data to a file or draws it in a live plot, so you never thread logging code through your step loop.

For the recording workflow and worked examples, see {doc}`/user_guide/sensing/recorders`.

## Components

- **Recorder:** the base class that processes each sampled value. See {doc}`recorder`.
- **RecorderManager:** the per-scene coordinator that drives every registered recorder as the scene builds, steps, and resets. See {doc}`recorder_manager`.
- **File writers:** `NPZFile`, `CSVFile`, and `VideoFile` persist data to disk, and `TrajectoryFile` records the scene itself for replay. See {doc}`file_writers`.
- **Plotters:** `PyQtLinePlot`, `MPLLinePlot`, `MPLImagePlot`, and `MPLVectorFieldPlot` visualize data live and can save the animation. See {doc}`plotters`.

Every recorder options class is exported from `gs.recorders`.

## Shared options

Every recorder options class inherits these fields from `RecorderOptions`.
