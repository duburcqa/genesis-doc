# Scene

The `Scene` is the top-level container for a simulation: add entities to it, build it, then step it. It is assembled from a bundle of options passed to `gs.Scene(...)`, each documented with the component it configures: `sim_options` (the {doc}`Simulator <simulator>`), the per-solver options (with each {doc}`solver <solvers/index>`), `coupler_options` (the {doc}`coupler <couplers/index>`), `viewer_options` and `vis_options` (the {doc}`viewer </api_reference/visualization/viewer>`), `renderer` (the {doc}`renderer </api_reference/visualization/renderers/index>`), and `profiling_options` below. Every option a scene is created with is held as one `SceneOptions` object, reachable as `scene.options` and documented below. For a worked example, see {doc}`/user_guide/getting_started/hello_genesis`.

## Scene options
