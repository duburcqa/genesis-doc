# Conventions

This page defines the conventions we follow throughout the API: the coordinate system, rotations, physical units, tensor shapes, and data types, plus the rules that decide how an imported asset is oriented.

## Coordinate system

We use a right-handed, Z-up coordinate system. Relative to the default viewer, whose camera sits on the `+X` side looking back toward the origin:

- **+X**: points out of the screen, toward the viewer.
- **+Y**: points to the viewer's right.
- **+Z**: points up.

## Quaternion representation

Quaternions follow the `(w, x, y, z)` convention:

- **w**: scalar (real) component.
- **x, y, z**: vector (imaginary) components.

We follow the scalar-first Hamilton convention, so provide a quaternion in this order wherever the API takes one.

```python
# 90-degree rotation about the +Z axis
quat = (0.707, 0.0, 0.0, 0.707)  # (w, x, y, z)
```

Euler angles, where they are accepted instead, are extrinsic x-y-z in degrees (SciPy's convention).

## Gravity

Gravity defaults to `(0, 0, -9.81)`, i.e. `-Z` with a magnitude of 9.81 m/s². With no other forces applied, objects fall along `-Z`. Set it for the whole scene through `gs.options.SimOptions(gravity=...)`, or for one solver through the `gravity` field of its own options, and change it at runtime through that solver, for example `scene.rigid_solver.set_gravity(gravity, envs_idx)`.

## Axis conversion at import time

Asset formats disagree about which axis points up, and some do not record it at all. The sections below give the rule we apply to each format on its way into our Z-up space.

### Choosing one Y-up mapping

A Y-up-to-Z-up conversion is a 3×3 rotation, and several rotations are valid depending on which axis the asset treats as forward. Two meshes can both be labeled Y-up and still import at different orientations, so the forward axis is what decides the rotation.

We therefore commit to one mapping, `(X, Y, Z) → (X, -Z, Y)`, which is **Y-up, -Z forward**. That is Blender's default configuration when it exports to a Y-up format, and we match it because Blender is a common authoring tool for robotics and simulation assets and its exporters apply well-defined conversions per target format.

An asset exported from Blender at default settings therefore arrives at the orientation you saw in Blender, whether it came as glTF, STL, OBJ, or a mesh referenced from URDF. Wherever these docs say "Y-up", they mean this mapping.

### glTF (.gltf, .glb)

glTF assets are [always Y-up by specification](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#coordinate-system-and-units), so we always convert them, with no switch to turn that off: a glTF file that follows the spec then behaves the same everywhere.

Blender writes a Z-up glTF if you uncheck **+Y-up**, though it cannot read that file back correctly afterward. Since our conversion assumes the spec, a Z-up glTF imports rotated. Re-export with the default **+Y-up** option rather than overriding the axis on import.

See [Blender's glTF exporter documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.83/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html#transform) for the transform settings.

### STL (.stl) and Wavefront OBJ (.obj)

Neither format records a coordinate system, and files of both kinds arrive Y-up or Z-up depending on the tool that wrote them, so you declare which one you have:

- **Z-up (default):** the mesh is assumed to be in Z-up space already, and nothing is converted.
- **Y-up:** we apply the `(X, Y, Z) → (X, -Z, Y)` mapping above.

Declaring it at import means assets from different sources coexist in one scene without you editing the files.

See [Blender's Wavefront OBJ exporter](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.0/files/import_export/obj.html#object-properties) and [Blender's STL exporter](https://docs.blender.org/manual/fr/3.6/addons/import_export/mesh_stl.html#transform) documentation.

### Declaring the up-axis on import

Pass `file_meshes_are_zup` to a mesh morph to tell Genesis World how the referenced meshes are oriented. It defaults to `True` (already Z-up); set it to `False` for a Y-up asset that needs conversion:

```python
obj = scene.add_entity(
    gs.morphs.Mesh(
        file="my_obj_file.obj",
        file_meshes_are_zup=False,  # mesh is Y-up; convert to Z-up on import
    ),
)
```

After import, the `imported_as_zup` metadata flag on each mesh records whether a conversion ran:

```python
obj.vgeoms[0].mesh.metadata["imported_as_zup"]  # False if a Y-up -> Z-up conversion ran
```

## Units

Genesis World is unitless in the sense that it does no conversion for you, but every built-in default is expressed in **SI units**, and the API assumes you follow suit:

- **Length** in meters, **mass** in kilograms, **time** in seconds.
- **Angles** in radians, with one deliberate exception: Euler angles passed to morphs are in **degrees** (see the rotation section above).
- **Derived quantities** follow from these: density in kg/m³, force in newtons, gravitational acceleration in m/s².

The simulation timestep is a duration in seconds, defaulting to `dt = 1e-2` (10 ms):

```python
gs.options.SimOptions(dt=0.01)  # seconds
```

A few APIs carry their own natural units where SI would be awkward. For example, a drone's propellers take angular speed in **RPM**, and the temperature-grid sensor reports **degrees Celsius**. These are called out on the pages and in the docstrings where they appear. When in doubt, assume SI.

## Tensor shapes and batching

Genesis World simulates many environments in parallel (see {doc}`/user_guide/getting_started/parallel_simulation`), so most quantities carry an optional leading **batch dimension**. The docs and docstrings describe shapes with a bracket notation:

```
distances  # shape ([n_envs,] n_probes)
points     # shape ([n_envs,] n_probes, 3)
```

The `[n_envs,]` bracket means: **present when the scene is built with multiple environments, absent otherwise.** A scene built with `scene.build(n_envs=4096)` returns tensors with a leading `4096` dimension; a scene built without `n_envs` drops that dimension entirely rather than using a size-1 axis.

Methods that read or write per-environment state take an `envs_idx` argument to address a subset of environments. Passing `envs_idx=None` (the default) applies to all of them; passing a tensor of indices selects only those rows along the batch dimension.

## Data types and precision

Tensors returned by the API are **PyTorch tensors** placed on the active device (`gs.device`). Their dtype follows the precision chosen at initialization:

- **Floating-point values** are `float32` by default, or `float64` when you initialize with `precision="64"`.
- **Integer indices** (entity, link, and dof indices, `envs_idx`, and the like) are always `int32`, independent of the float precision.

`gs.init()` sets PyTorch's global default dtype and device to match, so tensors you allocate yourself line up with what the API returns. See {doc}`initialization` for how to choose the backend and precision.
